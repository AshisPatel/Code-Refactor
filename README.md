## End Note - A Thank You to the Reader 

Thank you for reading through my README! As a reward, I present to you one fun fact, and a link to a fun website. Please enjoy them at your leisure. 

**Fun fact**: Greyhounds can beat cheetahs in a race. While cheetahs can run twice as fast as greyhounds, they can only maintain that 70 mph speed for about thirty seconds. A Greyhound can maintain a 35 mph speed for about seven miles. So, the cheetah may start out first, but the greyhound will soon overtake him.
