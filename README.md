## A Breakdown on Website Accessibility & SEO 

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** refers to the practice of optimizing one's website and HTML to maximize visibility of a webpage to a search engine. **Website Accessibility** refers to how easily a website can be used by anyone, including those with various impairments. These impairments refer not only to sensory and neurological impairments but also situational / environmental impairments like accessing the website with limited internet connection or not being able to play audio. 

While making websites accessible should be a general best practice without incentive, there is an overlap between SEO and accessibility. The practice of using semantic HTML elements and complete tags is one such overlap. The best overlap to showcase this is **alt text**, which provides text alternatives for images. Alt text ensures that those with visual impairments can still understand content on a webpage that has a relevant image associated with it. Additionally, the alt text helps search engine crawlers understand the context of the image to determine if the image should be displayed in an image search. With descriptive alt text, the user has a better experience and the website shows up in more relevant searches! 

## End Note - A Thank You to the Reader 

Thank you for reading through my README! As a reward, I present to you one fun fact, and a link to a fun website. Please enjoy them at your leisure, maybe share them with a friend? 

**Fun fact**: Greyhounds can beat cheetahs in a race. While cheetahs can run twice as fast as greyhounds, they can only maintain that 70 mph speed for about thirty seconds. A Greyhound can maintain a 35 mph speed for about seven miles. So, the cheetah may start out first, but the greyhound will soon overtake him.
